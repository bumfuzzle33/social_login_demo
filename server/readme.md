# Social Login Demo App
## Get started :
### Step 1 : clone the respository
### Step 2 : Go to server folder and run npm install do the same with client folder (npm install)
### Step 3 : Go to client directory and run npm start (you could also build and start it).
### Step 4 : Go to server directory and run npm run dev (to run it in dev mode) or  npm run start (to run it as production)
### Note:
>Run the client on localhost:3000 and the server on localhost:4000
### Step 5 : Go to localhost:3000 and use the social login methods to login to the demo application

## Some notes:
###  I have included the .env file in the server folder with this project.
> We should never share a .env file to a git repo as it is a bad practise, users viewing the file could obtain out valueble information for the purposes of this "demo" project i have included it, but in real circumstances NEVER DO IT!!
